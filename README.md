Evently
=======
Evently is a Facebook events app. This app answers the question of who from an event's guest list is actually at the event. The app achieves this by performing an automatic GPS-based check-in when guests are near the event's venue. Then other event attendees can see a list of the attendees who have arrived.

Other features we're considering:
- Push notification when you arrive at event, sent to the rest of guest list
- Event reminder notifications (reminding you 30 minutes before an event you RSVPed for)
- Map with event location and location of guests on their way to event
- Find friends inside event venue (iBeacon)
- Share content with attendees (photos, videos, etc.)
